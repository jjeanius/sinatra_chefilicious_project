sinatra_chefilicious_project

I enjoyed working on this Sinatra project.   This project is a continuation of my first CLI project for many reasons; I like the meal kits concept and I really believe you can create, modify a comprehensive app that target this growing industry.

Over all, I think this project allowed me to put my learning and my knowledge into practice.  As for my app, I can envision this app helping a company keeping track of customers, orders, inventory and even sales.  One of the advantages of this application is its flexibility and there is still room for improvement; and Iâ€™m really looking forward to all of the good improvement that I will make as my study continue.
